This data was created by inserting a set of tags to a record in MEDLINE速/PubMed速, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine.
The tags inserted to the original records are: "sentence", "PPI", "GDA", "event_expression", "phrase", "word", "entity_name", "event_expression", "bib", "article", "sentence_type", "annotation", "linguistic_annotation" and "entity_annotation", and this "attribution" tag.
Any other tags/text are derived from a MEDLINE速/PubMed速 record without modification, except that Article tags in the original record is renamed to Article.orig.

Polymorphic repeat in AIB1 does not alter breast cancer risk . 378-85 STATEMENT OF FINDINGS : We assessed the association between a glutamine repeat polymorphism in AIB1 and breast cancer risk in a case-control study ( 464 cases , 624 controls ) nested within the Nurses ' Health Study cohort . We observed no association between AIB1 genotype and breast cancer incidence , or specific tumor characteristics . These findings suggest that AIB1 repeat genotype does not influence postmenopausal breast cancer risk among Caucasian women in the general population .
