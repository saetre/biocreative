This data was created by inserting a set of tags to a record in MEDLINE速/PubMed速, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine.
The tags inserted to the original records are: "sentence", "PPI", "GDA", "event_expression", "phrase", "word", "entity_name", "event_expression", "bib", "article", "sentence_type", "annotation", "linguistic_annotation" and "entity_annotation", and this "attribution" tag.
Any other tags/text are derived from a MEDLINE速/PubMed速 record without modification, except that Article tags in the original record is renamed to Article.orig.

RACK-1 overexpression protects against goniothalamin-induced cell death . 118-22 Goniothalamin , a styryllactone , has been shown to induce cytotoxicity via apoptosis in several tumor cell lines . In this study , we have examined the potential role of several genes , which were stably transfected into T-cell lines and which regulate apoptosis in different ways , on goniothalamin-induced cell death . Overexpression of full-length receptor for activated protein C-kinase 1 ( RACK-1 ) and pc3n3 , which up-regulates endogenous RACK-1 , in both Jurkat and W7.2 T cells resulted in inhibition of goniothalamin-induced cell death as assessed by MTT and clonogenic assays . However , overexpression of rFau ( antisense sequence to Finkel-Biskis-Reilly murine sarcoma virus-associated ubiquitously expressed gene ) in W7.2 cells did not confer resistance to goniothalamin-induced cell death . Etoposide , a clinically used cytotoxic agent , was equipotent in causing cytotoxicity in all the stable transfectants . Assessment of DNA damage by Comet assay revealed goniothalamin-induced DNA strand breaks as early as 1 h in vector control but this effect was inhibited in RACK-1 and pc3n3 stably transfected W7.2 cells . This data demonstrate that RACK-1 plays a crucial role in regulating cell death signalling pathways induced by goniothalamin .
