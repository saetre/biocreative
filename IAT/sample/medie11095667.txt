This data was created by inserting a set of tags to a record in MEDLINE速/PubMed速, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine.
The tags inserted to the original records are: "sentence", "PPI", "GDA", "event_expression", "phrase", "word", "entity_name", "event_expression", "bib", "article", "sentence_type", "annotation", "linguistic_annotation" and "entity_annotation", and this "attribution" tag.
Any other tags/text are derived from a MEDLINE速/PubMed速 record without modification, except that Article tags in the original record is renamed to Article.orig.

Intact MutY and its catalytic domain differentially contact with A/8-oxoG-containing DNA . 4593-603 Escherichia coli MutY is an adenine and a weak guanine DNA glycosylase active on DNA substrates containing A/G , A/8-oxoG , A/ C or G/8-oxoG mismatches . A truncated form of MutY ( M25 , residues 1-226 ) retains catalytic activity ; however , the C-terminal domain of MutY is required for specific binding to the 8-oxoG and is critical for mutation avoidance of oxidative damage . Using alkylation interference experiments , the determinants of the truncated and intact MutY were compared on A/8-oxoG-containing DNA . Several purines within the proximity of mismatched A/8-oxoG show differential contact by the truncated and intact MutY . Most importantly , methylation at the N7 position of the mismatched 8-oxoG and the N3 position of mismatched A interfere with intact MutY but not with M25 binding . The electrostatic contacts of MutY and M25 with the A/8-oxoG-containing DNA substrates are drastically different as shown by ethylation interference experiments . Five consecutive phosphate groups surrounding the 8-oxoG ( one on the 3 ' side and four on the 5 ' side ) interact with MutY but not with M25 . The activities of the truncated and intact MutY are modulated differently by two minor groove-binding drugs , distamycin A and Hoechst 33258 . Both distamycin A and Hoechst 33258 can inhibit , to a similar extent , the binding and glycosylase activities of MutY and M25 on A/G mismatch . However , binding and glycosylase activities on A/8-oxoG mismatch of intact MutY are inhibited to a lesser degree than those of M25 . Overall , these results suggest that the C-terminal domain of MutY specifies additional contact sites on A/GO-containing DNA that are not found in MutY-A/G and M25-A/8-oxoG interactions .
